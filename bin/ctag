# If you're new to ctags, here's the quick intro:
#
# It's just a little database that lets you hop to definitions, quickly.
# If you have a favorite GUI that does something like this, it either uses
# ctags internally or does something similar.

[ "`uname`" != Darwin -o -e /usr/local/bin/ctags ] || brew install ctags

# Quickref:
# For vim, the CLI use is:
#   vim -t all_latest_job_applications_for_any_version
# And while inside vim, you can:
#  - hit ^] to hop to the current word as a tag
#  - do :ta whatever_tag  (with tabcompletion!)
# Plus the list-selection versions (for when there are plural definitions):
#  - hit g] to hop to the current word as a tag, but with a menu first
#  - :tj whatever_tag  to hop directly if only one match, otherwise show the menu
# Other commands:
#  - Go back to where you were with ^t
#  - Find more with :h tags

# Without these options, a basic 'ctags -R' generates a 180Mb+ tags file, which
# takes a few minutes to generate.
# With these options, it's <3Mb, and takes under a second
ctags -R --languages=Ruby --totals
