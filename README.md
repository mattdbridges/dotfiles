# Dotfiles

Dotfiles I have been grooming for quite a while. It has gone through several iterations due to changes in how I manage them.

Currently, I am using [`rcm`](https://github.com/thoughtbot/rcm).

## Install

```
$ zsh <(curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdespuits/dotfiles/master/exe/install)
```

## Prerequisites

**None!** The install script handles major dependencies and configuration needs.
